<u1></li> <p>Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.
 While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.
 Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate a great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at a youth hostel.
 He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan. He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.
 In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.<br></p>
 <p>Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania;he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer:
 at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.
 In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.<br></p>
<p>Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.
