    <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.
 Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
 Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</p><p>
 Foloowing a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.
