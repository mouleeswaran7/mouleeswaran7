    <p>In an interview with The Washington Post, Musk stated he was a "significant (though not top-tier) donor to Democrats," but that he also gives heavily to Republicans. Musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement to have a voice in the United States government.
 Musk has criticized Donald Trump and after joining Trump's two business advisory councils, Musk resigned from both in June 2017 in protest against Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.
 In the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income;
 he endorsed Kanye West's independent campaign in the general election.Musk has stated that he thinks a theoretical government on Mars should be direct democracy.
</p>
     <p>In July 2020, Musk tweeted "Pronouns suck" to significant backlash on Twitter, including from his partner Grimes.
The tweet has been perceived by some as transphobic and an attack on non-binary identities.In a series of December 2020 tweets, Musk again mocked the use of pronouns.
 The Human Rights Campaign, which had previously given Tesla the number one ranking on its Corporate Equality Index, criticized his tweets and called for him to apologize.
</p>
     <p>Musk has stated that he does not believe the US government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to discourage poor behavior.
 Musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.
  His stance has been called hypocritical as his businesses have received billions of dollars in subsidies.
     </p>Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.
 Musk's opposition to short-selling has been speculated to stem from how short-sellers often organize and publish opposition research about the companies that they believe currently overvalued.
 In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.Musk has also regularly promoted cryptocurrencies, stating that he supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.
 Given the volatile effects that his tweets about them have, his statements around cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulations by critics such as Nouriel Roubini.
